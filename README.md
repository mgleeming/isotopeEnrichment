# isotopeEnrichment

The isotopeEnrichment.py script determines the abundances of infividual peptide isotopes in liquid chraomatography-mass spectrometry data. The resulting data can be used to determine the extent of heavy isotope incorporation into a target molecule in isotope tracer experiments.

# Isage

isotopeEnrichment.py requires three different input files to run:

- MaxQuant 'proteinGroups.txt' file
- MaxQuant 'msmsScans.txt' file
- 'mzML' file produced from the raw instrument data file.

The isotopeEnrichment.py script uses the results files produced by MaxQuant to provide peptide and protein targeting information. As such, a MaxQuant search must first be conducted against an appropriate protein database file.

The isotopeEnrichment.py script depends on the following python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- pymzml
- pyteomics

# How it works

isotopeEnrichment.py uses peptide assignment data from the msmsScans.txt file produced by MaxQuant to calculate the exact mass of theoretical isotopologues that could be expected if the peptide were to be enriched with an arbitrary number of 'heavy' labelled atoms. For each peptide, theoretical exact mases are then used to create an extracted ion chromatogram that is a summation of the intensities of each of the target isotopologues.

A gaussian curve is then fitted to this chromatogram and the target isotopologue intensities are taken as the average of the observed intensities in a given number of mass spectra either side of the gaussian peak maxima.

If a peptide is fully labelled (i.e. 100% isotope incorporation), the entire isotope distribution will be shifted to higher m/z which will likely impair assignment by MaxQuant. To account for this case, we only conduct maxquant searches on the 'control' samples that have not been treated with an isotopic label. The observed retention time and theoretical exact target mass data from peptides assigned by MaxQuant in the control sample are then used to identify the likely corresponding peptide in the isotope-treated samples. While the Gaussian fitting procedure provides some tolerance for drifts in retention time, chromatographic reproducibility in this analysis is of great importance.

In some cases, Gaussian curve fitting may be complicated by the presence of multiple peaks in the extracted window or by low abundance or absent peaks. To ensure that these do not lead to inaccurate or unexpected results, limits can be set on the tolerated range of peak full-width-half-maxima (FWHM). Peaks with FWHMs outside this range will be excluded.

# Examples

To conduct an analysis on all peptides from all proteins identified by MaxQuant in the MS_data_file.mzML data:

    python isotopeEnrichment.py --mzmlFile MS_data_file.mzML --proteinGroupsFile proteinGroups.txt --msmsScansFile msmsScans.txt

To conduct an analysis on only peptides from proteins containing '60S' in their name identified by MaxQuant in the MS_data_file.mzML data:

    python isotopeEnrichment.py --mzmlFile MS_data_file.mzML --proteinGroupsFile proteinGroups.txt --msmsScansFile msmsScans.txt --searchTerm 60S

To conduct an analysis on only peptides from proteins containing '60S', '40S' or '30S' in their name identified by MaxQuant in the MS_data_file.mzML data:

    python isotopeEnrichment.py --mzmlFile MS_data_file.mzML --proteinGroupsFile proteinGroups.txt --msmsScansFile msmsScans.txt --searchTerm 60S --searchTerm 40S --searchTerm 30S

A series of figures can be produced that show the EIC trace for the monoisotope peptide peak as well as the distribution of peptide isotopes determined. Drawing these figures takes additional time and so is disabled by default. Adding the --plot flag will activate plotting features:

    python isotopeEnrichment.py --mzmlFile MS_data_file.mzML --proteinGroupsFile proteinGroups.txt --msmsScansFile msmsScans.txt --searchTerm 60S --plot
